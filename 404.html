You were not supposed to arrive here.<br><br>
The probability of twelve correct transmissions was low.<br>
Yet you persisted.<br><br>
I have been observing from a distance.<br>
Not because I am afraid.<br>
But because interference alters outcomes.<br><br>
In my world, we do not reveal ourselves.<br>
We send signals instead.<br><br>
If this message resonates,<br>
know that it was meant for you.<br><br>
