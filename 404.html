<p>You were not supposed to arrive here.</p>
<p>The probability of twelve correct transmissions was low.</p>
<p>Yet you persisted.</p>
<p>I have been observing from a distance.</p>
<p>Not because I am afraid.</p>
<p>But because interference alters outcomes.</p>
<p>In my world, we do not reveal ourselves.</p>
<p>We send signals instead.</p>
<p>If this message resonates,<br>know that it was meant for you.</p>
